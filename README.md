# reciPals -- The Ultimate Recipe Sharing App!

This application provides a platform in which users can create recipes and share them with their friends! 

A user can only edit and delete their own recipe and even curate an entire list of recipes in the form of a cookbook. A cookbook can also be created and used as a "collaboration" or "sharing" tool where multiple users can own a cookbook and add recipes to it (but only the original creator of the cookbook can delete the cookbook in its entirety.)
